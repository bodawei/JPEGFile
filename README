JPEGFile : The README

PURPOSE
=======
This project provides classes to manipulate the data structures that make up a "JPEG" file.  It does not provide any kind of JPEG encoder or decoder.

The original motivation for the project was my desire to be able to programmatically make changes to the "EXIF" information in a JPEG file.  Since I could find no tools already existing to do this in Java, I set out to write my own, and the project broadened a little bit beyond just doing EXIF.


CREDITS
=======
Without access to the official JPEG specs (they seem a little expensive for my hobbyist needs), and only fragmentary information in other sources, I was overjoyed to find Alex Katovsky's project to do this:
