* Architecture changes
  * Deal with imperfect data better
	* EOF or length too long: ?
	* length too short  (can't happen)
	* length and internal data say different things
	* internal data has invalid values (we could allow)
* Can we explain the other structures as well as Dht?

* In JpegParser
** what should isValid do?
** Create a subtype of DataInput which keeps track of what byte one is at (so can be put in error, and perhaps reported usefully in jpeg file?
* Exif or other metadata added
* Finish JpegParser
* Do a jpeg scanner? (e.g. find me this one segment without reading everything in so much)
